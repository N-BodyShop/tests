The script 'metalcheck.sh' is designed to run a series of tests to check if the metal 
yields of gasoline match those we expect analytically.  

YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY ONE LINE IN ORDER TO RUN THIS CODE PROPERLY:
Before you run metalcheck.sh, you must edit the second line to reflect YOUR updated, 
compiled version of gasoline.  Once you have pointed to your pkdgrav directory, 
nothing else needs to be changed. 

Running the script: THIS SCRIPT REQUIRES IDL
Immediately upon running the script, you will be asked for one piece of input.  
You must declare whether you are running gasoline using a Miller-Scalo (MS) or 
Kroupa (K) IMF.  The script calls a number of IDL programs in order to do its job. 

NOTE: The script will run a simulation that contains one star (zero metallicity) 
inside a virialized ball of gas.  The timesteps of this simulation, and various 
other output generated by the code and script, will be put in your working 
directory.  

RESULTS of the script: A series of information regarding the expected analytical 
yields and the actual yields generated in the simulation is output to the screen.  

This code generates a number of files.  To remove the files produces in running 
the script, run clean.sh.  You may then run the script again if you need to.
