1) YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY THE FILE 'mf.sh' TO RUN THIS TEST
   - Replace 'pkdgravdir' with the path to your working version of pkdgrav
   - Replace 'skiddir' with the path to your working version of skid
   - Replace 'sodir' with the path to your working version of SO
All three of these can be checked out from the cvs repository

2) THIS TEST CALLS ON AN IDL PROGRAM TO RUN

3) After making the modifications in 1, simply type "mf.sh" at the prompt 
to run the test.  The test will first run a simulation of a 0.3,0.7,0.7,1 LCDM 
concordance cosmology large volume, 48^3 particles, 300 Mpc on a side.  It 
then runs SKID and SO on the results, and then calls an IDL program (mf2.pro) 
to compare the resulting mass function to the expected mass function.  You can 
expect all this to take an hour or two to run on a single processor (though 
expect deviations based on processor speed).
  - If the mass function matches that expected, a congratulatory statement is 
    sent to the screen
  - If the mass function varies from that expected by more than 5% at any 
    given mass, a warning is directed to the screen.  Information on the 
    deviating points is printed to the screen.  A plot showing the expected 
    mass function and the produced mass function is created, called 'test.ps'.

4) To remove the files produced by the test, type 'clean.sh'

NOTE: The mass function that the script uses for comparison was previously 
generated by this run, and compared to Press-Schecter theory to be certain 
that the simulation got reasonable results.  The file "ps.ps" shows the 
results of that initial test (dotted line = PS theory, solid = simulation 
result), and is included here ONLY for full disclosure to the curious.
