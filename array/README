These are a collection of utilities to manipulate the tipsy "array" and
"vector" files.

Note on format:
All files are assumed to be ASCII, with the first line containing
the number of particles, and then one line per particle.  For vector
quantities, the values are "unpacked", meaning that the order is all the x
coordinates, all the y coordinates, and all the z coordinates.
