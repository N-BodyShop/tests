Non-periodic force error tests.

forces_e0.direct.sh is a shell script to create the true forces.  These
are included already, so this script SHOULD NOT be run.

tstforce_XXX.sh actually runs pkdgrav or gasoline and compares the
forces with those calculated by direct.

RMS should be in the range of .1 to .2 percent.

Max could be from 4% to 20%.
