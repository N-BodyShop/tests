Non-periodic force error tests.

forces_e0.direct.sh is a shell script to create the true forces.  These
are included already, so this script SHOULD NOT be run.

tstforce_XXX.sh actually runs pkdgrav or gasoline and compares the
forces with those calculated by direct.

RMS should be in the range of .1 to .2 percent.

Max could be from 4% to 20%.

NOTE:
A change in vector output was made in the June 06 version of
PKDGRAV/GASOLINE: "unpacked" ASCII vectors are no longer supported. This was
to enable reasonably efficient parallel output.  Use
"tstforce_pkdgrav06_30K.sh" for testing later versions of
pkdgrav/gasoline.
